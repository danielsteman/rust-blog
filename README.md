# Blog

I have made several iterations of [my blog](https://www.danielsteman.com). I'll make one more and I'll make it leaner and faster than ever before.

## Backend

The content of the blog is served directly from Markdown files and compressed images stored in the backend package.

```
cargo install cargo-watch
cd backend
cargo watch -x run
```
